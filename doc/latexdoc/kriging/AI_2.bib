abstract = {An efficient geometry optimization algorithm based on interpolated potential energy surfaces with iteratively updated Hessians is presented in this work. At each step of geometry optimization (including both minimization and transition structure search), an interpolated potential energy surface is properly constructed by using the previously calculated information (energies, gradients, and Hessians/updated Hessians), and Hessians of the two latest geometries are updated in an iterative manner. The optimized minimum or transition structure on the interpolated surface is used for the starting geometry of the next geometry optimization step. The cost of searching the minimum or transition structure on the interpolated surface and iteratively updating Hessians is usually negligible compared with most electronic structure single gradient calculations. These interpolated potential energy surfaces are often better representations of the true potential energy surface in a broader range than a local quadratic appr...},

abstract = {The trust-region self-consistent field (TRSCF) method for optimization of total energy of Hartree-Fock theory and Kohn-Sham (KS) theory. The Fock/Kohn-Sham matrix diagonalization step to obtain density matrix and to determine optimal density matrix in subspace of density matrices were improved in TRSCF method. The local models had same gradient such as total energy at the point of expansion. A monotonic and significant reduction of total energy is ensured in each iteration of TRSCF method by restricting steps of TRSCF model to be inside the trust region. The examples are also discussed where TRSCF method converges monotonically and smoothly.},

@article{Schlegel2011,
abstract = {Geometry optimization is an important part of most quantum chemical calculations. This article surveys methods for optimizing equilibrium geometries, locating transition structures, and following reaction paths. The emphasis is on optimizations using quasi-Newton methods that rely on energy gradients, and the discussion includes Hessian updating, line searches, trust radius, and rational function optimization techniques. Single-ended and double-ended methods are discussed for transition state searches. Single-ended techniques include quasi-Newton, reduced gradient following and eigenvector following methods. Double-ended methods include nudged elastic band, string, and growing string methods. The discussions conclude with methods for validating transition states and following steepest descent reaction paths. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.
