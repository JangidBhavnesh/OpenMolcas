%%%<MODULE NAME="SLAPAF">
%%Description:
%%%<HELP>
%%+This program is a general purpose facility for geometry
%%+optimization. At present, it is tailored to use analytical gradients
%%+produced by
%%+ALASKA.
%%+SLAPAF also computes an approximate Hessian.
%%%</HELP>

Provided with the first order derivative with respect to nuclear displacements
the program is capable to optimize molecular structures with or
without constraints for minima or
transition states. This will be achieved with a quasi-Newton approach
in combination with 2nd ranks updates of the approximate Hessian or
with the use of a computed (analytic or numerical) Hessian.
Note that {\it if} a computed Hessian is available on the
\file{RUNFILE} then it will be used rather than the approximate Hessian generated by \program{Slapaf}.
{\bf On completion of an optimization \program{SlapAf} will automatically execute a single energy evaluation}.

\subsection{Description}
\label{UG:sec:SlapAf_description}

\program{SlapAf} has three different ways in selecting the
basis for the displacements during the optimization.
The first format require user input (not recommended), whereas the two other options are totally black-boxed.
The formats are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
the old format as in \molcasiii, which is user specified.
The internal coordinates
are here represented as linear combination of internal coordinates
(such as bonds, angles, torsions, out of plane angles, Cartesian coordinates
and separation of centers of mass) and the linear combinations are totally defined
by user input.
This format does also require the user to specify the
Hessian (default a diagonal matrix).
This option {\it allows} for frozen internal coordinates.
\item
the second format is an automatic
option which employs the Cartesian eigenvectors of the approximative Hessian (generated by the
Hessian model functional \cite{HMF}).
\item
the third format (this is the recommend and default) is an automatic option which utilizes linear combinations
of some curvilinear coordinates (stretches, bends, and torsions).
This implementation
has two variations. The first can be viewed as the conventional use of
non-redundant internal coordinates \cite{nric1,nric2,nric3}.
The second variation is a force constant weighted (FCW)
redundant space (the HWRS option) version of the former
implementation \cite{Lindh:97}.
\end{enumerate}
All three formats of internal coordinates can be used in combinations with
constraints on the molecular parameters or other type of constraints as for
example energy differences.

The displacements are symmetry adapted
and any rotation and translation if present is deleted.
The relaxation is symmetry preserving.

\subsection{Dependencies}
\label{UG:sec:SlapAf_dependencies}
\program{SlapAf} depends on the results of \program{ALASKA} and also possibly
on \program{MCKINLEY} and \program{MCLR}.

\subsection{Input}
\label{UG:sec:SlapAf_input}
\program{SlapAf} will as standard
provided with an energy and a corresponding gradient
update the geometry (optimize).
Possible update methods include different quasi-Newton methods.
The program will also provide for updates of the Hessian.
The program has a number of different variable metric methods available for
the Hessian update.

\subsubsection{Definition of internal coordinates or constraints}
\label{UG:sec:definition_of_internal_coordinates}

The input section defining the internal coordinates always start with the
keyword \keyword{Internal coordinates} and the definition of the constraints
starts with the keyword \keyword{Constraints}. Note that the latter
is an input section for the \program{GATEWAY} module.

The input is always sectioned into two
parts where the first section defines a set of primitive internal
coordinates
and the second part defines the actual internal coordinates as
any arbitrary linear combination of the primitive internal coordinates
that was defined in the first section.
In case of constraints the second part does also assign values to the
constraints.

In the first section we will refer to the atoms by their atom label
(\program{SEWARD} will make sure that there is no redundancy). In case of
symmetry one will have to augment the atom label with a symmetry operation
in parenthesis in order to specify a symmetry related center.
Note that the user only
have to specify distinct internal coordinates (\program{ALASKA} will make the
symmetry adaptation).

In the specification below {\em rLabel} is a user defined label with no more
than 8 (eight) characters. The specifications atom1, atom2, atom3, and atom4
are the unique atom labels as specified in the input to \program{SEWARD}.

{\bf The primitive internal coordinates} are defined as

\begin{itemize}
%---
\item
{\bf {\em rLabel} = Bond atom1 atom2 }---
a primitive internal coordinate {\em rLabel} is defined as the bond
between center atom1 and atom2.
%---
\item
{\bf {\em rLabel} = Angle atom1 atom2 atom3} ---
a primitive internal coordinate {\em rLabel} is defined as the angle
between the bonds formed from connecting atom1 to atom2 and
connecting atom2 to atom3.
%---
\item
{\bf {\em rLabel} = LAngle(1) atom1 atom2 atom3} ---
a primitive internal coordinate {\em rLabel} is defined as the linear angle
between the bonds formed from connecting atom1 to atom2 and
connecting atom2 to atom3. To define the direction of the angle the following
procedure is followed.

\begin{enumerate}
\item -- {\it the three centers are linear},
\begin{enumerate}
\item
form a reference axis, {\bf R1}, connecting atom1 and atom3,
\item
compute the number of zero elements, {\it nR}, in the reference vector,
\begin{enumerate}
\item -- {\it nR=0},
a first perpendicular direction to the reference axis is formed by
\[{\bf R2}=(R1x,R1y,-R1z)\] followed by the projection
\[{\bf R2}={\bf R2}-\frac{ {\bf R2} \cdot {\bf R1} }{{\bf R1} \cdot {\bf R1}} {\bf R1}.\]
The second perpendicular direction completes the right-handed system.
\item -- {\it nR=1},
a first perpendicular direction to the reference axis is defined by setting the element in {\bf R2}
corresponding to the zero entry in {\bf R1} to unity.
The second perpendicular direction completes the right-handed system.
\item -- {\it nR=2},
a first perpendicular direction to the reference axis is defined by setting the element
corresponding to the first zero entry in {\bf R1} to unity.
The second perpendicular direction completes the right-handed system.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item -- {\it the three centers are nonlinear},
the first perpendicular direction is the one which is in the plane formed by atoms atom1, atom2, and atom3.
The second perpendicular direction is taken as the direction perpendicular to the same plane.
\end{enumerate}
The direction of the bend for {\bf LAngle(1)} is taken in the direction of the first perpendicular direction, etc.
%---
\item
{\bf {\em rLabel} = LAngle(2) atom1 atom2 atom3} ---
a primitive internal coordinate {\em rLabel} is defined as the linear angle
between the bonds formed from connecting atom1 to atom2 and
connecting atom2 to atom3. The definition of the perpendicular directions
is as described above. The direction of the bend for {\bf LAngle(2)} is taken in the direction of
the second perpendicular direction.
%---
\item
{\bf {\em rLabel} = Dihedral atom1 atom2 atom3 atom4} ---
a primitive internal coordinate {\em rLabel} is defined as the angle
between the planes formed of atom1, atom2 and atom3, and atom2,
atom3 and atom4, respectively.
%---
\item
{\bf {\em rLabel} = OutOfP atom1 atom2 atom3 atom4} ---
a primitive internal coordinate {\em rLabel} is defined as the angle
between the plane formed by atom2, atom3, and atom4 and the
bond formed by connecting atom1 and atom4.
%---
\item
{\bf {\em rLabel} = Dissoc (n1+n2) atom1 atom2 atom3 ... atomN} ---
a primitive internal coordinate {\em rLabel} is defined as the distance
between the center of masses of two sets of centers. The first
center has n1 members and the second has n2.
The input contains the labels of the atoms of the first group followed
immediately by the labels of the second group.
This option is not available for constraints.
%---
\item
{\bf {\em rLabel} = Cartesian i atom1} ---
a primitive internal coordinate {\em rLabel} is defined as the pure
Cartesian displacement of the center labeled atom1. The label
i is selected to x, y, or z to give the appropriate component.
%---
\item
{\bf {\em rLabel} = Ediff [i j]      } ---
the energy difference between states i and j (if provided, the brackets indicate they
are optional, do not include the brackets).
If i and j are not provided, the difference is between the ``current'' state and
the state provided on \file{RUNFILE2}.
This is only used in constrained optimization in which crossings or conical intersections
are located. If this constraint is used, the average energy of the two states will
be optimized, subject to the constraint. If the value is $0.0$ and the spin and spatial
symmetry of both states is the same, a conical intersection will be searched.
In this case, \program{SLAPAF} will request an analytical calculation of the nonadiabatic
coupling vector, if available. If it is not available, or if \file{RUNFILE2} is being used
(i and j not provided), the branching space update method of Maeda et al. will be used \cite{Maeda2010}.
\item
{\bf {\em rLabel} = Sphere           } ---
the radius of the hypersphere defined by two different molecular structures
(the origin is the first structure) in relative mass-weighted coordinates.
This is only used in constrained optimization in which minimum reaction paths (MEP) or intrinsic reaction
coordinate (IRC) paths are followed. The units of the radius is in mass-weighted coordinates
divided with the square root of the total mass of the molecule.
\item
{\bf {\em rLabel} = Transverse           } ---
a level of ``orthogonality''. This is used to perform an optimization in a space
orthogonal to a given vector. Recommended value $0.0$. Requires usage of GRAD keyword.
\item
{\bf {\em rLabel} = Fragment atom1 atom2 atom3 atom4} ---
a dummy internal coordinate {\em rLabel} is defined. This translates to
that a set of internal coordinates are generated automatically according
to a standard Z-matrix format to define all degrees of freedom
of the fragment defined by the list of atoms on the same line. These
internal coordinates will be automatically fixed in the geometry optimizations to
the values of starting structure. Note, the values of these do not need to
be explicitly defined and set in the \keyword{Values} section. Note, too, that
the generation of the internal coordinates is done according to the order
in which atom1, atom2, etc. are given; for some systems, especially with
linear angles, it may be preferable to define the coordinates manually.
\end{itemize}


The second section starts with the label \keyword{Vary} or in the case of constraints
with the label \keyword{Values}.

In case of a definition of {\bf internal coordinates} in this section the user
specifies all symmetric internal coordinates excluding translation and rotation
using a list of expressions like

         {\em label} = f1 {\em rLabel1} + f2 {\em rLabel2} + ....

which defines an internal coordinate {\em label} as the linear combination of the
primitive internal coordinates {\em rLabel1}, {\em rLabel2}, ... with the coefficients
f1, f2, ..., respectively. If the internal coordinate just corresponds to
the primitive internal coordinate, the same label can be used

         {\em label}

If some internal coordinates are chosen to be fixed they should be defined after
the label \keyword{Fix}. The fixed internal coordinate are defined with
expressions as in the section \keyword{Vary}. Observe: using expression can
introduce linear dependence and/or undefined nuclear coordinates, so use with care.\\
For the internal coordinates defined after \keyword{Vary} (and \keyword{Fix}, if present)
a numerical estimation of rows and columns of the hessian matrix can be performed. The
{\em label} of internal coordinates (max 10) must be specified after keyword \keyword{RowH}.
Keywords \keyword{NUMErical} and \keyword{RowH} are mutually exclusive.

In case of a definition of {\bf constraints} the sections contains either a
direct reference to a {\em rLabel} as in

     {\em rLabel} = {\em rValue} [Angstrom,Degrees] [Soft,Hard] [Phantom]

or one can also use expressions like

     f1 {\em rLabel1} +/- f2 {\em rLabel2} +/- .... = {\em Value} [Angstrom,Degrees] [Soft,Hard] [Phantom]

where {\em rValue} is the desired value of the constraint in au or rad, or in
angstrom or degrees if the corresponding keyword is added. The ``Hard'' and ``Soft''
keywords are only meaningful for numerical differentiation: the coordinates corresponding
to soft constraints are differentiated, those of hard constraints are not \cite{Stenrup2015}.
By default almost all constraints are hard, only constraints of the type ``Sphere'', ``Transverse''
and ``Ediff'' default to soft. The ``Hard'' and ``Soft'' keywords override the default.
When using constraints in combination with the \keyword{FINDTS} keyword, one should use
soft constraints, at least for the constraint most similar to the expected reaction vector.
Constraints defined in \keyword{TSCOnstraints} (recommended) are automatically considered
soft.

The ``Phantom'' modifier can be used to ignore a constraint in the optimization. A phantom
constraint will only be considered for numerical differentiation. Phantom constraints are
useful in combination with the \keyword{KEEPOldGradient} keyword of \program{ALASKA}.
Using \keyword{NGEXclude} in \program{GATEWAY} is equivalent to phantom constraints,
and it is the preferred way to set up composite gradients \cite{Stenrup2015}.

Alternatively, if the current value of an internal coordinate is to be used, i.e.
no change is to be allowed (frozen), this is expressed as

     {\em rLabel} = FIX [Soft,Hard] [Phantom]

Note that a coordinate of type ``Fragment'' does not need to appear in the \keyword{Values}
section, but if it does it must be assigned the value ``FIX''.

Example: A definition of user specified internal coordinates of benzene. The molecule is
in D$_{6h}$ and since \molcas\ only uses up to D$_{2h}$ the
\keyword{Fix} option is used to
constrain the relaxation to the higher point group. {\bf Observe} that this will
only restrict the nuclear coordinates to D$_{6h}$. The electronic wavefunction,
however, can have lower symmetry.
