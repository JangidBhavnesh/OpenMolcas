real*8 function FindDetR(matrix,n)
! Function to find the determinant of a square matrix
!
! Description: The Subroutine is based on two key points:
!
! 1]  A determinant is unaltered when row operations are performed:
!     Hence, using this principle, row operations (column operations
!     would work as well) are used to convert the matrix the matrix
!     into upper triangular form
! 2]  The determinant of a triangular matrix is obtained by finding
!     the product of the diagonal elements
